# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Package overview

`apps/web` is the Nuxt 4 frontend of the One Piece TCG simulator. It is a **pure client**: it holds no authority logic. Authentication, deck validation, game rules, and all state-of-record live in `apps/api` (NestJS). This package only renders UI, calls the API, and connects to the realtime Colyseus server. See `docs/spec.md` (source of truth for product scope) and `docs/optcg-rules.md` (source of truth for gameplay rules) before making changes that touch game logic or product scope — read them from the repo root. For anything gameplay-adjacent (targeting, phase gating, combat prompts), also cross-check against the primary rules sources `docs/rule_comprehensive.md` and `docs/rule_manual/`, since `docs/optcg-rules.md` is a condensed summary that can omit nuance present in the official rules.

## Commands

Run from `apps/web/`, or from the repo root with `pnpm --dir apps/web <script>`:

```bash
pnpm dev              # start Nuxt dev server (http://localhost:3000)
pnpm build            # production build
pnpm preview           # preview a production build locally
pnpm lint              # ESLint (Nuxt ESLint module)
pnpm typecheck         # nuxt typecheck (vue-tsc)
pnpm test              # vitest (watch mode)
pnpm test:run          # vitest (single run)
```

Run a single test file: `pnpm exec vitest run app/composables/useDuelRoom.spec.ts`.

CI (`apps/web/.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs `pnpm install`, `pnpm run lint`, and `pnpm run typecheck` — no test step is wired into CI yet, so run tests locally before submitting changes.

## Architecture

### App structure (Nuxt 4 `app/` directory convention)

- `app/pages/` — file-based routes: `index.vue` (home), `login.vue`, `decks.vue` (deck builder + integrated card catalogue, no separate `/catalogue` route per spec), `lobby.vue` (matchmaking/lobby, at `/lobby`), `zone/[roomId].vue` (live game board, keyed by the Colyseus room id so the URL is shareable/bookmarkable — `lobby.vue` navigates here as `/zone/${room.roomId}` once both players are ready)).
- `app/components/` — Vue components (PascalCase filenames). `PlayZone.vue`/`DuelBoard.vue` render the game board; `DuelCard.vue`/`DuelZoneSlot.vue`/`DuelSetupOverlay.vue` are duel-board pieces; `UserAccountMenu.vue` and `AppConfirmDialog.vue` are shared chrome.
- `app/layouts/` — `default.vue` and `lobby.vue` share the branded header (incl. logo), auth-aware user menu, and footer chrome; `simulator.vue` is a minimal layout for the live game board.
- `app/middleware/` — route middleware, e.g. `auth.ts` (auth-gated route protection).
- `app/utils/` — pure helpers used by components/composables, e.g. `cardStack.ts`, `deckRouteSelection.ts`.
- `app/composables/` — the integration layer with the backend, see below.
- `app/app.vue` — thin root shell (`UApp` → `NuxtLayout` → `NuxtPage`, plus `useHead`/`useSeoMeta`); the header/footer chrome lives in `app/layouts/`, not here. French UI copy (`lang="fr"`) — keep new user-facing strings in French to match existing pages.
- `app/assets/css/` — global CSS entrypoint registered in `nuxt.config.ts` (`css: ['~/assets/css/main.css']`).

### Composables (integration layer)

- `useApi()` — returns a `$fetch` instance pre-configured with `runtimeConfig.public.apiBase`, `credentials: 'include'`, and forwarded cookies (`useRequestHeaders(['cookie'])`). **Always** go through this composable for API calls instead of raw `$fetch`/`fetch`, so cookies and base URL stay consistent between SSR and client.
- `useSession()` — wraps auth state (`profile`, `loading`, `errorMessage`) using `useState` (SSR-safe shared state), backed by `GET /me` and Better Auth's sign-in/sign-out endpoints on the API. `login.vue` renders the Google/Discord OAuth entry points plus a development-only anonymous shortcut when running in dev mode, and delegates auth entirely to the backend.
- `useColyseus()` — client-only (`import.meta.client` guarded) wrapper around `colyseus.js`, connecting to `runtimeConfig.public.colyseusEndpoint` and joining the `duel` room (`joinOrCreate('duel', options)`). This is the sole channel for realtime game state; do not add other websocket clients.
- `useDuelRoom()` — game-board state composable built on top of `useColyseus()`.
- `useCardPreview()`, `useConfirmDialog()` / `useAppConfirmDialog()` — smaller UI-state composables (card zoom preview, the app-wide confirm dialog).

### Runtime config

`nuxt.config.ts` exposes two public runtime config values, both overridable via env vars:
- `NUXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE` (default `http://localhost:3000`) — NestJS API base URL.
- `NUXT_PUBLIC_COLYSEUS_ENDPOINT` (default `ws://localhost:3000`) — Colyseus websocket endpoint.

### Shared types

Card, deck, and game-state types (`Card`, `Deck`, `DeckValidation`, `PublicCard`/`PrivateCard`, `GamePhase`, `GameZone`, deck text import/export helpers, etc.) come from `@onepiecetcg/shared` (workspace package, `packages/shared/src/index.ts`). Prefer importing types/helpers from there over redefining local shapes that mirror API responses — it's the contract shared with the backend. Anything client-side that mirrors a server-authoritative check (e.g. deck validation) is a *preview* only; the API re-validates authoritatively and this package must never assume its own copy is sufficient.

### Client authority boundary

Per `docs/spec.md`, the server (NestJS + Colyseus) is the sole source of truth for game structure (zones, phases, turn order, targeting, hidden information) and for account/deck persistence. This package must never implement or duplicate authoritative logic (final deck validation, combat resolution, hidden-info gating) — only UI, optimistic previews, and rendering of server-pushed state.

## Styling and UI

Built on `@nuxt/ui` (v4) and Tailwind CSS v4. ESLint stylistic config in `nuxt.config.ts` enforces no trailing commas (`commaDangle: 'never'`) and 1tbs brace style. Icons come from `@iconify-json/lucide` and `@iconify-json/simple-icons` (`i-lucide-*`, `i-simple-icons-*` classes).

For Nuxt UI work, consult the AI-oriented documentation at `https://ui.nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/ai/llms-txt`. Start with `https://ui.nuxt.com/llms.txt` for component and pattern guidance; use `https://ui.nuxt.com/llms-full.txt` only when deeper implementation or migration detail is needed.

## AI-oriented documentation

For general Nuxt 4 work (routing, data fetching, SSR, plugins, runtime config, etc.), consult the AI-oriented documentation at `https://nuxt.com/docs/4.x/guide/ai/llms-txt`.

## Testing

Vitest with `@nuxt/test-utils` (`environment: 'nuxt'` in `vitest.config.ts`) and `@vue/test-utils`, using `happy-dom`. Test files follow `*.spec.ts` colocated next to the code they test — currently composables and utils (e.g. `app/composables/useDuelRoom.spec.ts`, `app/utils/cardStack.spec.ts`) have specs; no component has a `*.spec.ts` yet.
