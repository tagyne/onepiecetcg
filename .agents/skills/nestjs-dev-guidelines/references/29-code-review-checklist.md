# 29 — Code Review Checklist

## TL;DR

- A review has three outputs: **blockers**, **suggestions**, **approval (conditional on blockers)**.
- Block on: security, data-loss risk, broken non-negotiable, contract breakage. Suggest everything else.
- Cite the rule + reference file when flagging. Show the fix, don't just point.
- Read the diff end-to-end before commenting. Context comes first.

## Why it matters

Reviews are the primary gate between a mistake and production. Clear conventions convert
reviews from opinion battles into pattern matching — fast, consistent, and kind.

## Review mindset

1. **Intent first.** What is this PR trying to do? Read the description, then the tests, then the code.
2. **Correctness.** Does it do what it claims? Does it handle the unhappy paths?
3. **Security / data integrity.** Authn, authz, validation, SQL injection, PII, leaks.
4. **Consistency.** Does it follow the conventions in this skill + existing patterns in the repo?
5. **Observability.** Can we debug this in production?
6. **Tests.** Are they meaningful? Do they cover branches + edge cases?
7. **Performance.** Any N+1, unbounded list, missing index?
8. **Readability.** Will the next engineer understand this in 6 months?

## Blocker vs suggestion

| Category | Blocker | Suggestion |
|---|---|---|
| Security / auth bug | ✅ | |
| Data-loss possibility | ✅ | |
| Non-negotiable broken (see SKILL.md → Non-negotiables) | ✅ | |
| Contract break without deprecation path | ✅ | |
| Missing validation on user input | ✅ | |
| Missing auth on a protected route | ✅ | |
| SQL injection / string-concat query | ✅ | |
| Business logic in controller | ✅ | |
| No test for new branching logic | ✅ | |
| Missing `Idempotency-Key` on money POST | ✅ | |
| Wrong HTTP status / response contract | ✅ | |
| Direct provider SDK instead of LLM gateway | ✅ | |
| Brittle regex / keyword / prompt hack for a generalized behavior bug | ✅ | |
| Partial fix leaves other impacted callers, tests, or docs inconsistent | ✅ | |
| Naming not matching convention | | ✅ |
| Extra field in DTO | | ✅ |
| Opportunity to simplify | | ✅ |
| Minor perf improvement | | ✅ |
| Docs/comment quality | | ✅ |

**Do not raise:** style/taste debates (formatting, naming preferences, paradigm wars). Use linters
and formatters for those.

## Sectional checklist

### Correctness

- [ ] PR description matches the diff
- [ ] Happy path works (verified by test or local reasoning)
- [ ] Unhappy paths handled (empty, missing, invalid, concurrent, auth failure)
- [ ] The fix addresses the underlying bug class, not just one observed string, screenshot, or prompt (`00`)
- [ ] Transactions wrap multi-row / multi-table writes (`04`, `13`)
- [ ] No silent error swallow; all `catch` either recover or rethrow (`10`)
- [ ] When shared code or a contract changed, all impacted callers, tests, docs, and examples were updated (`00`, `25`)

### Security

- [ ] Every route guarded; `@Public()` opt-out is deliberate (`12`, `17`)
- [ ] Object-level authorization check after authentication (`11`)
- [ ] DTO with class-validator on every input; `whitelist` + `forbidNonWhitelisted` (`09`)
- [ ] Parameterized queries only; no string-concatenation (`11`, `14`)
- [ ] Sort / filter fields whitelisted (`08`)
- [ ] Rate limiting on sensitive routes (`11`)
- [ ] No secrets in code or commits (`20`)
- [ ] No PII in logs or errors (`21`, `11`)
- [ ] Passwords via Argon2id (`12`)
- [ ] Session ids and refresh tokens stored only as hashes/HMACs (`12`, `11`)
- [ ] Cookie SameSite mode matches deployment topology; CSRF protection exists for cookie-auth mutations (`12`, `11`)
- [ ] File uploads: size + type + magic-byte check; presigned direct-to-bucket where possible; opaque tenant-prefixed storage keys; server-computed hash/size/mime; AV scan before exposure; upload endpoints rate-limited (`11`, `37`)
- [ ] Webhook signatures verified on raw bytes with constant-time compare; dedupe on `(provider, event_id)`; ack `2xx` after enqueue (incl. unhandled types); re-fetch authoritative state for high-stakes events; verification in `integrations/`, controller in `modules/<feature>/webhooks/` (`11`, `06`, `36`)
- [ ] Audit log for privileged actions (`11`)

### Multi-tenancy (if applicable)

- [ ] Tenant id comes from trusted auth/session context, not the request body (`33`)
- [ ] Client DTOs cannot set or override tenant ownership fields (`33`, `09`)
- [ ] Repositories filter by tenant on reads, updates, deletes, and counts (`33`, `14`)
- [ ] List endpoints include tenant scope in both data and count queries (`33`, `08`)
- [ ] Role/permission checks run after tenant membership is established (`33`, `12`)
- [ ] Cross-tenant access returns safe not-found/forbidden deliberately (`33`, `10`)
- [ ] Background jobs and internal callers carry tenant context (`33`, `19`)
- [ ] E2E/integration tests seed ≥ 2 tenants and assert isolation (`33`, `23`)
- [ ] Migrations that add tenant scope to live tables are staged and backfilled (`33`, `15`)

### API

- [ ] URL uses plural nouns, kebab-case, versioned (`06`)
- [ ] HTTP verb + status code match meaning (`06`)
- [ ] `Idempotency-Key` on state-creating POSTs (`06`)
- [ ] Response contract is consistent: single success is a plain object, list success is `{ data, meta }`, error is `{ code, message, details?, traceId }` (`07`, `10`)
- [ ] List endpoints paginate, and the pagination model is justified by real UX + consistency + scale needs (`08`)
- [ ] Pagination usage is consistent with sibling endpoints and shared DTO/contracts where appropriate (`00`, `08`)
- [ ] `meta.pagination` shape matches the endpoint's chosen model (cursor vs offset) (`07`, `08`, `25`)
- [ ] If cursor/keyset is used with configurable sort, cursor payload + seek predicate + index match the active sort tuple (`08`)
- [ ] Error responses: `{ code, message, details?, traceId }`, namespaced codes; shaped by one global exception filter, no leaked stack/SQL/third-party messages (`10`, `39`)
- [ ] Swagger decorators: `@ApiTags`, `@ApiOperation`, `@ApiResponse` per status (`25`)

### Data / DB

- [ ] Tables plural snake_case; columns snake_case (`13`)
- [ ] FKs indexed; `ON DELETE` behavior explicit (`13`, `16`)
- [ ] Timestamps `timestamptz`; soft delete where appropriate (`13`)
- [ ] Money as integer minor units; never float (`13`)
- [ ] Unique constraints respect soft delete (partial unique) (`13`)
- [ ] Migration: forward-only; single logical change; `CONCURRENTLY` for big indexes (`15`)
- [ ] No cross-module DB reads (`03`)
- [ ] Zero-downtime rollout for destructive changes (`15`)

### Code quality / structure

- [ ] Controller is thin; service has logic; repository has DB (`04`)
- [ ] Constructor DI; no `new Service()`; no static service methods (`04`)
- [ ] No `any` without a comment explaining why (`04`)
- [ ] Functions ≤ ~30 lines; early returns; no deep nesting (`04`)
- [ ] No mutation of function arguments (`04`)
- [ ] Module has clean boundary; `@Global()` only for infra (`03`)
- [ ] `index.ts` exports only the public API (`03`)
- [ ] Folder structure matches `01` (core/common/integrations/modules/events/commands)
- [ ] File and symbol names follow `02`

### Decorators / scopes / dynamic modules

- [ ] Custom param decorators only extract from the request; identity/auth comes from a guard, not the decorator (`38`, `12`)
- [ ] Validation lives in pipes/DTOs, not in decorators that throw on bad shape (`38`, `09`)
- [ ] Providers default to `Scope.DEFAULT` (singleton); `Scope.REQUEST` is justified and the cascade impact understood (`38`)
- [ ] Dynamic modules (`forRoot` / `forRootAsync`) used only for configurable infra/SDKs, not feature modules (`38`, `03`)
- [ ] No `forwardRef` without an explicit reason; circular dependency broken at the design level when possible (`38`, `03`)

### Design / SOLID / maintainability

- [ ] Each class/function has one clear responsibility; no mixed HTTP/domain/DB/provider concerns (`04`)
- [ ] New behavior extends the design cleanly; no boolean flags or mode branches forcing unrelated use cases together (`04`)
- [ ] The diff does not hardcode one phrase, regex, keyword, or prompt rule where the real behavior should be semantic, state-based, or architectural (`00`, `04`)
- [ ] Implementations behind one interface are substitutable; no surprising behavior, unsupported methods, or incompatible return/error contracts (`04`)
- [ ] Dependencies are narrow; consumers are not forced to depend on methods they do not need (`04`)
- [ ] Business logic depends on abstractions/DI, not concrete SDKs, framework globals, or infrastructure details (`04`, `26`)
- [ ] Cohesion is high and coupling is low; the change does not require lockstep edits across distant modules without a strong reason (`04`)
- [ ] Side effects are encapsulated; network/DB/queue/clock randomness is isolated behind clear boundaries (`04`, `19`)
- [ ] Naming is consistent with domain language across DTOs, services, events, and persistence (`04`, `02`, `13`)
- [ ] Reuse was considered before adding new helpers/services, and shared behavior was not changed silently (`00`, `04`)

### Testing

- [ ] New service logic has unit tests (`23`)
- [ ] New endpoint has at least one e2e happy-path + one error-path (`23`)
- [ ] Tests mock at boundaries, not internals (`23`)
- [ ] No flaky / skipped / `only` tests committed (`23`)
- [ ] Integration tests use transaction isolation (`23`)

### Observability

- [ ] Structured logging (nestjs-pino); no `console.log` (`21`)
- [ ] Redaction covers `authorization`, `cookie`, `password`, `token` (`21`)
- [ ] Correlation `traceId` propagated through jobs + outbound HTTP (`21`, `22`)
- [ ] Custom spans / metrics for business-important operations (`22`)
- [ ] LLM calls traced through Langfuse/Helicone when applicable (`22`, `26`)

### Background jobs / events (if applicable)

- [ ] Handlers idempotent (`18`, `19`)
- [ ] Retries bounded with backoff; DLQ monitored (`19`)
- [ ] Event naming `subject.verb-past-tense` (`18`)
- [ ] Outbox pattern when durability needed (`18`)
- [ ] `traceId` propagated through job / event payloads (`18`, `19`)

### Lifecycle (health / readiness / shutdown)

- [ ] Liveness and readiness are separate endpoints/signals (`34`)
- [ ] Healthy → `200`; not-ready → `503`; liveness keeps returning `200` during drain (`34`)
- [ ] Liveness avoids DB/Redis/network I/O (`34`)
- [ ] Readiness stays false during startup and drain; flips true only after pools are warmed (`34`)
- [ ] `SIGTERM` is trapped; drain finishes inside the orchestrator's grace period (`34`)
- [ ] Exactly one shutdown coordinator owns process signals (`34`)
- [ ] Shutdown marks readiness false, waits for LB drain, then closes resources in dependency order (`34`)
- [ ] Drain wait matches the LB's probe-failure threshold, not just one probe interval (`34`)
- [ ] DB/Redis/queue health checks have timeouts and release pool clients (`34`, `24`)
- [ ] Workers drain in-flight jobs and close queue connections (`34`, `19`)
- [ ] Bootstrap order: observability → app → globals → shutdown → startup → listen → ready (`32`)
- [ ] Module system (ESM vs CJS) consistent across source, build, tests, runtime (`32`)

### AI product (if applicable)

- [ ] Features call `LlmService`, not provider SDKs directly (`26`)
- [ ] Timeouts + retries + fallback configured (`26`)
- [ ] Structured output validated with Zod (`26`)
- [ ] Prompt versioned + cached where appropriate (`26`)
- [ ] Usage metered; quota enforced before the call (`28`)
- [ ] Streaming: abort on client disconnect; heartbeat; standard event types (`27`)
- [ ] Cost stored as integer minor units (`28`)

### Performance

- [ ] No N+1 (relations batch-loaded or joined) (`24`, `14`)
- [ ] List queries have matching indexes (`13`, `08`)
- [ ] `SELECT` only needed columns
- [ ] Outbound calls have timeouts (`24`, `10`)
- [ ] CPU-heavy / slow work queued, not inline (`19`)
- [ ] Streams for large payloads; no unbounded buffering (`24`)

### Caching (if applicable)

- [ ] Cache has a measured or clearly stated benefit (`24a`)
- [ ] Cache keys are stable, namespaced, and tenant/user-scoped where data is scoped (`24a`, `33`, `31`)
- [ ] TTL and invalidation path are defined (`24a`, `24`)
- [ ] Stampede behavior considered for hot keys (`24a`, `24`)
- [ ] Cache is not the sole authority for auth, quota, or billing (`24a`, `11`)
- [ ] Hit/miss/error metrics recorded (`24a`, `22`)

## Reviewing the review comment

Before posting:

- Is this a blocker or a suggestion? Label it.
- Have you cited the rule / reference?
- Did you provide the fix or an example, not just "this is wrong"?
- Did you check whether the diff fixes the class of issue rather than one literal trigger?
- Is the tone kind? Short, direct, not personal.

Good:
> **Blocker** — SQL string concatenation is a SQL injection risk (see `11-security.md` → SQL injection prevention). Change to parameterized: `pool.query('SELECT ... WHERE email = $1', [email])`.

Bad:
> This looks wrong. Why are you doing this??

## Review flow (summary to leave)

End your review with:

```
## Blockers
1. Business logic in controller (`src/modules/users/users.controller.ts:42`). Move to `UsersService`. See `04-code-quality.md` → Layering.
2. Missing auth guard on `DELETE /v1/payments/:id` (`src/modules/payments/payments.controller.ts:88`). See `12-authentication-patterns.md`.
3. No `Idempotency-Key` on `POST /v1/payments` (`src/modules/payments/payments.controller.ts:24`). See `06-api-design.md` → Idempotency.

## Suggestions
- Consider extracting cost calculation into a pure util (`src/modules/payments/payments.service.ts:120`).
- `@ApiProperty` missing on `amountCents` (`src/modules/payments/dto/create-payment.dto.ts:18`); Swagger docs will be less helpful without it.

## Approval
Approve pending blockers 1–3.
```

## Anti-patterns (bad reviews)

- Blocking on style / taste. Use linters instead.
- Missing the broader bug because the shown example happens to pass.
- "Have you considered X?" without evidence X is better.
- Drive-by comments without reading the surrounding code.
- Personal attack language.
- Re-review cycling — raise all blockers in the first pass, not one per round.
- Approving without reading because the author is senior.
- Rejecting without actionable next steps.

## Code review checklist (meta — for the reviewer)

- [ ] Read PR description before code
- [ ] Read diff end-to-end before commenting
- [ ] Blockers are truly blockers (security / data / non-negotiable)
- [ ] I checked whether the fix solves the broader failure mode, not just one example
- [ ] I checked whether impacted callers/tests/docs/contracts were updated where needed
- [ ] Suggestions are helpful, not preferences
- [ ] Each comment cites the rule and offers a fix
- [ ] Overall verdict at the end (approve / request changes / comment)
