# 06 — API Design

## TL;DR

- REST, with plural nouns for resources: `/users`, `/payments`, `/conversations/:id/messages`.
- URI versioning: `/v1/...`. Bump major version on breaking changes; never break v1 in place.
- HTTP verbs match semantics: `GET` read (safe, idempotent), `POST` create / action, `PUT` full replace (idempotent), `PATCH` partial update, `DELETE` remove (idempotent).
- Status codes match meaning — don't `200 { "error": ... }`. Use `400`, `401`, `403`, `404`, `409`, `422`, `429`, `500`, `503`.
- Idempotency key on any `POST` that creates money or side-effects: `Idempotency-Key: <uuid>`.
- `Accept`, `Content-Type`, `If-Match` — use HTTP primitives before inventing custom headers.
- All list endpoints paginate. All writes validate.

## Why it matters

A consistent API is a contract. Clients (web, mobile, partners, internal) assume behavior
from shape. Breaking the contract silently breaks consumers. A self-consistent API needs no
docs to use; an inconsistent one is bug-bait even with perfect docs.

## URL conventions

- Plural resource names: `/users`, `/orders`.
- Singular for a specific instance: `/users/:id` (`:id` is the instance of the plural).
- Nested resources when ownership is strict: `/organizations/:orgId/members`. Avoid deeper
  than two levels — if you need three, redesign.
- Kebab-case for multi-word: `/organization-members`, not `/organizationMembers`.
- Action endpoints as sub-resources: `POST /payments/:id/refund` (verb after the resource)
  for actions that don't fit CRUD.
- No verbs in plain resource URLs: `POST /users` (not `POST /createUser`).

## Versioning

```ts
// main.ts
app.enableVersioning({
  type: VersioningType.URI,
  defaultVersion: '1',
});

// controller
@Controller({ path: 'users', version: '1' })
export class UserController {}

// or opt out for stable infra
@Controller({ path: 'health', version: VERSION_NEUTRAL })
export class HealthController {}
```

- **URI is the default.** It is visible in URLs, easy to log, easy to route, and easy to cache.
- **Other Nest versioning modes** (`VersioningType.HEADER`, `MEDIA_TYPE`, `CUSTOM`) are valid for
  internal or partner APIs where you don't want the version in the URL. Pick one mode per service
  and stick to it — mixing modes confuses every client.
- **Bump v1 → v2** only for breaking changes: removed fields, changed semantics, renamed keys.
- **Additive changes are non-breaking:** new optional fields, new endpoints. Ship in v1.
- **Deprecation:** mark in Swagger (`@ApiOperation({ deprecated: true })`) + `Sunset` header for 90 days before removal.

## HTTP verbs

| Verb | Purpose | Safe | Idempotent | Body |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| GET | read | ✅ | ✅ | no |
| HEAD | metadata only | ✅ | ✅ | no |
| POST | create or action | ❌ | ❌ | yes |
| PUT | full replace | ❌ | ✅ | yes |
| PATCH | partial update | ❌ | ❌ | yes |
| DELETE | remove | ❌ | ✅ | optional |

**Idempotent** means: multiple identical requests produce the same result. `PUT /users/:id`
with the same body always leaves the same row. `POST /payments` without an idempotency key does not.

### PUT vs PATCH — when to use which

This is the most common verb mistake. Use the table, then read the rules below.

| You want to… | Verb | Body | Idempotent? |
|---|---|---|---|
| Replace the whole resource (all fields) | `PUT` | full representation | ✅ yes (by definition) |
| Change a few fields, leave the rest alone | `PATCH` | only the changed fields | ⚠️ depends on the patch |
| Trigger an action (refund, send, cancel) | `POST /resource/:id/<action>` | action input | ❌ — use `Idempotency-Key` |
| Toggle a single state field (`isActive`) | `PATCH` with `{ "isActive": true }` | partial | ✅ in practice |

**Rules:**

1. **`PUT` replaces the entire resource.** The client must send every writable field. Missing
   fields are interpreted as "unset" or default — not "leave unchanged." If you skip a field on
   `PUT`, you will silently wipe it. Two identical `PUT` calls always leave the same row → idempotent.

2. **`PATCH` updates only the fields the client sends.** Other fields are untouched.
   `PATCH /users/:id { "email": "new@x.com" }` changes `email` and nothing else.

3. **`PATCH` is *not* guaranteed idempotent.** A "merge patch" (RFC 7396, the common case where
   the body is just the changed fields) applied twice does produce the same state — so it
   *behaves* idempotently. But a "JSON patch" with operations like
   `{ "op": "increment", "value": 1 }` does not. Treat `PATCH` as **not idempotent in general**
   and accept `Idempotency-Key` whenever the change has side-effects (notifications, billing,
   audit log entries).

4. **Never use `PUT` for partial updates.** It is the single most common API bug. If the client
   only knows about 3 fields and you have 10, a `PUT` will wipe the other 7.

5. **Never `PUT` server-managed fields.** Strip `id`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`, `tenantId`,
   `ownerId` from the DTO before applying the replace. Mass-assigning these is a security and
   data-integrity bug.

```http
# Good — full replace, all fields present
PUT /v1/users/u_123
{ "email": "a@x.com", "name": "A", "role": "admin", "isActive": true }

# Good — partial update, only what changed
PATCH /v1/users/u_123
{ "role": "viewer" }

# Bad — PUT with only one field will wipe the rest
PUT /v1/users/u_123
{ "role": "viewer" }
```

If you don't have a strong reason to support full-replace, **prefer `PATCH`**. Most resources
should never see a `PUT` in practice.

## Status codes

| Code | Meaning | Use when |
|---|---|---|
| 200 | OK | Read success, sync action success |
| 201 | Created | POST that creates a resource — include `Location` header |
| 202 | Accepted | Async: queued for processing |
| 204 | No Content | DELETE success, PUT with no body |
| 301/302/303/307/308 | Redirect | Don't redirect in JSON APIs unless intentional |
| 400 | Bad Request | Malformed body, invalid JSON |
| 401 | Unauthorized | Missing/invalid auth |
| 403 | Forbidden | Authenticated, but not allowed for this resource |
| 404 | Not Found | Resource doesn't exist (or user can't see it) |
| 409 | Conflict | State conflict: duplicate email, version mismatch |
| 410 | Gone | Previously existed, permanently removed |
| 412 | Precondition Failed | `If-Match` ETag mismatch (optimistic concurrency lost the race) |
| 422 | Unprocessable Entity | Validation failed (syntactically OK, semantically wrong) |
| 429 | Too Many Requests | Rate limited — include `Retry-After` |
| 500 | Internal Server Error | Unhandled/unknown |
| 502 | Bad Gateway | Upstream returned garbage |
| 503 | Service Unavailable | Overloaded / maintenance — include `Retry-After` |
| 504 | Gateway Timeout | Upstream didn't respond |

**Never** return `200` with `{ "success": false, "error": ... }`. That breaks every HTTP
client library. Use the right status code.

## Idempotency

For any POST that causes side effects (create, charge, send), accept an `Idempotency-Key` header.

```
POST /v1/payments
Idempotency-Key: 5b3a7c8f-...  ← client-generated UUID
Content-Type: application/json

{ "amount": 1000, "currency": "usd" }
```

Server:
1. Look up key in `idempotency_keys` table (scope: tenant + user + route + key — see [`33-multi-tenancy-patterns.md`](./33-multi-tenancy-patterns.md)).
2. If present with a saved response → return the saved response (same body, same status, same headers).
3. If not → process; save request fingerprint + response; return.
4. If present with a different request body → 422 `IDEMPOTENCY.KEY_MISMATCH`.

TTL: 24h typical. Stripe-style — replays after the TTL are treated as new requests.

## Request / response content

- `Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8` for JSON.
- `Accept: application/json` — reject others with `406`.
- JSON keys are `camelCase`. Dates in ISO 8601 UTC (`YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.sssZ`).
- Money as integers in minor units (`amountCents: 1000` = $10.00), or string decimals (`"10.00"`) — never floats.
- Enums as stable string literals (`"pending"`), not numbers.
- For list responses, follow the `{ data, meta }` envelope from [`07-standard-responses.md`](./07-standard-responses.md). For errors, follow the `{ code, message, details?, traceId }` shape from [`10-error-handling.md`](./10-error-handling.md).

## Standard headers

| Header | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `Authorization: Bearer <token>` | JWT or opaque token (programmatic clients, mobile, partners) |
| `Cookie: <session>` | Browser-first products — see [`12-authentication-patterns.md`](./12-authentication-patterns.md) for cookie vs Bearer precedence |
| `Idempotency-Key: <uuid>` | Deduplicate POST / side-effecting PATCH |
| `If-Match: <etag>` | Optimistic concurrency — server returns `412` on mismatch |
| `Accept-Language: <lang>` | I18n |
| `X-Request-ID: <request-id>` | Correlation (opaque request id; server validates it, generates one if missing/invalid, echoes back the final value) |
| `Retry-After: <seconds>` | 429 / 503 hint |

## List, filter, sort, paginate

Collection endpoints should follow one consistent filtering/sorting/pagination contract. Some
endpoints expose user-configurable `sort`; others keep sort fixed for keyset pagination.

Example:

```
GET /v1/payments?filter[status]=paid&filter[createdAfter]=2026-01-01&limit=50&cursor=...
```

See [`08-pagination-filters-sorting.md`](./08-pagination-filters-sorting.md).

## Long-running actions

Rule of thumb, not a hard cutoff:

- Sync if **p95 latency < ~200ms** and the work is local: `200 OK`.
- Async if p95 is higher, the work calls an external API, or the work is variable: `202 Accepted`
  with a `jobId` in the body and a polling endpoint or webhook.

```json
{ "jobId": "job_7a2c...", "status": "queued", "pollUrl": "/v1/jobs/job_7a2c..." }
```

## Webhooks (outbound)

This section is about **delivering** webhooks to your consumers. For **receiving** webhooks
from external providers (Stripe, GitHub, etc.), see [`36-webhooks.md`](./36-webhooks.md) — the
verification, dedupe, and acknowledge-fast rules live there.

If you deliver webhooks, treat consumers as you'd like to be treated:

- POST JSON to their URL.
- Sign with HMAC (`X-Signature: sha256=...`) using a per-endpoint secret.
- Include event id, type, timestamp, resource id, and the resource snapshot.
- Retry with exponential backoff on 5xx / timeouts; dead-letter after 24h.
- Expose a replay endpoint.

See [`19-background-jobs.md`](./19-background-jobs.md) for retry infrastructure.

## RESTful vs RPC

NestJS makes RPC easy (`@Post('doTheThing')`). Resist. Map to REST when possible:

| RPC | REST equivalent |
|---|---|
| `POST /createUser` | `POST /users` |
| `POST /activateUser` | `PATCH /users/:id { "isActive": true }` |
| `POST /sendInvoice` | `POST /invoices/:id/send` (action sub-resource) |
| `POST /searchUsers` | `GET /users?filter[...]` |

Action sub-resources are a compromise — use them when the action isn't a state change you can
model as `PATCH`. "send", "refund", "cancel" are fine.

## Good vs bad

### Good
```http
POST /v1/payments
Authorization: Bearer eyJ...
Idempotency-Key: 5b3a-...
Content-Type: application/json
{ "amount": 1000, "currency": "usd", "customerId": "cus_123" }

HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Location: /v1/payments/pay_abc
X-Request-ID: req_xyz
{ "id": "pay_abc", "status": "pending", "amount": 1000, ... }
```

### Bad
```http
POST /v1/doPayment
{ "amt": "10.00", "currency": "USD", "user": 123 }

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
{ "success": false, "errorMessage": "insufficient funds", "code": -5 }
```

Issues: verb in URL, abbreviated key, float amount, wrong HTTP status, ad-hoc error code.

## Anti-patterns

- Verbs in URLs (`/getUser`, `/doAction`).
- `200 OK` with `{ "error": ... }`.
- Mixing case styles in JSON keys.
- Float amounts.
- Breaking v1 in place instead of bumping to v2.
- Nested > 2 levels (`/orgs/:a/teams/:b/projects/:c/tasks/:d`) — flatten with query params.
- Mass-assigning whole rows (`PUT /users/:id` that replaces `id`, `createdAt`).
- Using `PUT` for partial updates (silently wipes any field the client didn't send).
- POST without idempotency for money.
- Single monolithic `GET /data?type=X`.
- Custom auth schemes — use `Bearer` or cookie; don't invent `X-My-Auth`.
- Bulk endpoints that return `200 OK` for partial failures with no per-item status. If you ship
  `POST /v1/users/bulk`, return a per-item result array (`{ id, status, error? }[]`) and choose a
  status code that reflects the worst outcome (`207 Multi-Status` or split success/failure).

## Code review checklist

- [ ] URL uses plural nouns, kebab-case, `/v1/...`
- [ ] HTTP verb matches semantics (GET safe, idempotent; POST creates; etc.)
- [ ] `PUT` only used for full-replace; partial updates use `PATCH`; `PUT` does not accept server-managed fields (`id`, `createdAt`, `tenantId`)
- [ ] Status code matches outcome (no `200` for errors); `412` returned on `If-Match` mismatch
- [ ] Money-moving POST (and side-effecting PATCH) accepts `Idempotency-Key`
- [ ] `Location` header on 201; `Retry-After` on 429/503
- [ ] JSON keys `camelCase`, dates ISO 8601, money as ints or string decimals
- [ ] Pagination on all list endpoints (`08`)
- [ ] Request body validated via DTO (`09`)
- [ ] Response follows the standard contract from `07`
- [ ] Errors follow error taxonomy (`10`)
