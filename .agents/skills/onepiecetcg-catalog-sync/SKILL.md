description: Download OPTCG API card data into local edition JSON snapshots and normalize it to the shared One Piece TCG card schema. Use when refreshing `packages/cards/catalog/`, maintaining the standalone `@onepiecetcg/cards` package, grouping all cards for an edition into a single file such as `OP-01.json`, preparing deterministic `--source-file` inputs for `onepiecetcg-effect-generation`, or mapping OPTCG API fields onto `@onepiecetcg/shared` `Card` objects.

# OPTCG Catalog Sync

Download card metadata from the OPTCG API, normalize it to the shared card schema, validate the downloaded snapshots, and write one deterministic JSON snapshot per edition family.

Use this skill when you need an offline catalog snapshot for effect generation, fixture generation, local inspection of all cards in an edition, or to maintain the reusable `@onepiecetcg/cards` package API over those snapshots, including promo cards and DON!! cards.

## Workflow

1. Read `references/project-context.md` to confirm where catalog snapshots live, how `@onepiecetcg/cards` consumes them, and which public API surface must stay valid.
2. Read `references/source-and-output.md` to see which OPTCG API families to fetch, how to bucket cards by edition, and which shared fields must be preserved.
3. Use `scripts/run-download-catalog.sh` to fetch the source data from the OPTCG API or to replay a local snapshot.
4. Pass `--edition OP-01` for a single edition or `--edition OP-01,OP-02` to download multiple editions in the same request.
5. Use `scripts/run-validate-catalog.sh` to validate the downloaded snapshots before reusing them.
6. Normalize each card to the `@onepiecetcg/shared` `Card` shape.
7. Group cards by edition family prefix and write each edition into its matching folder, for example `packages/cards/catalog/OP/OP-01.json` or `packages/cards/catalog/EB/EB-01.json`.
8. For promo cards, write every card returned by `https://www.optcgapi.com/api/allPromoCards/` into `packages/cards/catalog/P/P.json` without removing or adding entries.
9. For DON!! cards, write every card returned by `https://www.optcgapi.com/api/allDonCards/` into `packages/cards/catalog/DON/DON.json` without removing or adding entries.
10. Keep the output deterministic: stable ordering, stable ids, and no duplicate cards inside the same edition file.
11. Preserve the standalone package contract: each snapshot file must remain a top-level object shaped as `{ editionId, name, cards }`, and the package loaders in `packages/cards/src/index.ts` must still be able to discover and parse it.
12. When the snapshot is ready, pass it to `onepiecetcg-effect-generation` with `--source-file` if you need to generate or refresh effect definitions without hitting the network.
13. If you touch the package API or snapshot structure, rerun `pnpm --dir packages/cards test:run` and `pnpm --dir packages/cards exec tsc -p tsconfig.json --noEmit`.

## Working Rules

- Keep the snapshot data authoritative for metadata only; do not invent gameplay text or effect behavior.
- Prefer the shared `Card` schema from `packages/shared` over ad hoc JSON shapes.
- Preserve upstream card identifiers and edition identifiers exactly as normalized by the catalog pipeline.
- Write all cards for the same edition into the same file, nested in the folder named after the edition prefix (`OP`, `EB`, `ST`, and so on).
- Use the edition id and edition name returned by `https://www.optcgapi.com/api/allSets/` when writing snapshot metadata.
- Keep `packages/cards/package.json` and `packages/cards/vitest.config.ts` aligned with the repo's current lightweight package setup unless the user explicitly asks for a packaging change.
- When a consumer needs catalog data from code, prefer the public helpers exported by `@onepiecetcg/cards` over ad hoc filesystem reads.
- Use this skill as the bridge between live OPTCG API data and effect-generation workflows.
- Treat promo and DON!! snapshots as complete endpoint mirrors: keep every returned card, preserve their upstream identifiers, and do not filter them down to edition families.

## Typical Triggers

- Build or refresh local OPTCG edition snapshots.
- Build or refresh one edition or several editions in the same command.
- Validate the schema and structure of downloaded edition snapshots.
- Normalize OPTCG API responses into the shared `Card` type.
- Generate deterministic JSON inputs for `onepiecetcg-effect-generation`.
- Maintain the standalone `@onepiecetcg/cards` package API and tests when snapshot structure or package wiring changes.
- Inspect or reconcile edition-level card data before authoring card effects.
