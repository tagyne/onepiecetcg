# Project Context

## Repository scope

This skill is tailored to `/home/verbq/Documents/dev/onepiecetcg`.
The reusable engine lives in `packages/effect-engine/`. Authored effect-definition source files now live in `packages/cards/src/effects/`, and the backend in `apps/api/` consumes them through `@onepiecetcg/cards/effects` at runtime.

Before changing effect behavior, read:

- `docs/spec.md`
- `docs/rule_comprehensive.md`
- `docs/optcg-rules.md`

## Skill-owned tooling

The execution layer for this skill lives in the skill folder itself:

- `scripts/generate_effect_definitions.py`
  Load card metadata, preserve already-authored card blocks, generate placeholder blocks for uncovered cards, rewrite edition files, rewrite aggregate indexes, then validate.
- `scripts/validate_effect_definitions.py`
  Parse authored `*.effects.ts` and `*.special.ts` files directly and report structural problems.
- `scripts/effect_skill_lib.py`
  Shared metadata normalization, file parsing, rendering, and validation helpers.
- `scripts/run-generate-effects.sh`
  Thin shell wrapper around the Python generator.
- `scripts/run-validate-effects.sh`
  Thin shell wrapper around the Python validator.

These scripts intentionally avoid importing or invoking application-local CLI implementation under `apps/api/src/` or `packages/effect-engine/src/`.

## Project files this skill reads or writes

- `packages/cards/src/effects/`
  Root effect-definition folder.
- `packages/cards/src/effects/<FAMILY>/`
  One family folder per product line prefix such as `OP`, `ST`, or `EB`, containing edition files and a family index.
- `packages/cards/src/effects/<FAMILY>/special/`
  Imperative special handlers for outlier cards in that family.
- `packages/cards/src/effects/index.ts`
  Aggregate family export list and aggregated `specialHandlerDefinitions`.

## What this skill is responsible for

This skill is responsible for:

1. finding card metadata
2. selecting which cards need an effect-definition entry
3. generating edition file scaffolds in the correct family folder
4. preserving existing authored entries
5. validating the resulting definition set

This skill is not responsible for:

- booting the backend CLI
- resolving effects at runtime
- inventing missing card facts
- replacing `docs/rule_comprehensive.md` with a summary
