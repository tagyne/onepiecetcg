# Validation Rules

## Goal

Validate the effect-definition file set before it is consumed by the reusable effect runtime.

## Validation entrypoint

Use:

```bash
python3 .agents/skills/onepiecetcg-effect-generation/scripts/validate_effect_definitions.py
```

Or:

```bash
./.agents/skills/onepiecetcg-effect-generation/scripts/run-validate-effects.sh
```

## What the validator reads

By default, the validator reads:

- `packages/cards/src/effects/*/*.effects.ts`
- `packages/cards/src/effects/*/special/*.special.ts`

It does not validate aggregate index files directly.

## Validation invariants

The validator checks:

1. duplicate edition ids
2. duplicate card ids across all edition files
3. duplicate effect ids across all cards
4. duplicate special handler ids
5. missing special handlers referenced by `special-ref`
6. orphan special handlers not referenced by any card
7. special-handler card mismatches
8. card id / edition id mismatches

## Meaning of each failure

### `DUPLICATE_EDITION_ID`

Two edition files claim the same `editionId`.

### `CARD_ID_EDITION_MISMATCH`

A card block is stored in the wrong edition file.

Example:

- `OP01-006` inside `OP-02.effects.ts`

### `DUPLICATE_CARD_ID`

The same card appears in more than one edition file.

### `DUPLICATE_EFFECT_ID`

Two authored DSL effects share the same `id`.

Effect ids must be globally unique across all edition files.

### `DUPLICATE_SPECIAL_HANDLER_ID`

Two special handlers share the same id, or two cards reference the same special handler id improperly.

### `MISSING_SPECIAL_HANDLER`

A card uses `kind: 'special-ref'` but the referenced handler does not exist in that family's `special/` directory.

### `ORPHAN_SPECIAL_HANDLER`

A special handler file exists but no card references it.

### `SPECIAL_HANDLER_CARD_MISMATCH`

The handler file declares one `cardId`, but a different card references it.

## Validation workflow

Use this sequence:

1. generate or edit edition files
2. implement the full DSL for every generated placeholder card in scope
3. choose the right test layer for the touched behavior:
   - `packages/effect-engine/src/effect-engine.spec.ts` for reusable runtime or rules behavior
   - edition-specific specs such as `packages/cards/src/effects/OP/OP-01.effects.spec.ts` for card-level effect behavior
   - `packages/effect-engine/src/effect-loader.spec.ts` when loader or registry wiring changes
4. add or update tests at that layer so the important touched behavior is covered
5. when you add card-level coverage, cover the complete effect path: trigger, optional decisions, costs, target selection, modifiers, moves, and final state
6. use the card text as a verification checklist: assert the gameplay meaning of each important clause the description expresses, including ownership words, optional wording, quantity bounds, and ordered "then" sequencing when present
7. ensure aggregate indexes are current
8. run the validator
9. fix every reported issue
10. scan the generated edition again for unfinished placeholder-only card blocks
11. rerun until validation passes cleanly, no unfinished generated placeholders remain, and the touched behavior is covered at the appropriate test layer with assertions that prove concordance with the card text

The file set is only ready when both conditions are true:

1. validation succeeds with zero reported issues
2. the generated edition contains no unfinished generated placeholders for the requested scope

The effect work is only ready when these test conditions are also true:

3. the touched behavior is covered at the appropriate test layer rather than only by incidental coverage
4. card-specific suites exist for special handlers, uniquely complex effects, ambiguous texts, or especially critical cards
5. the relevant tests explicitly verify that the implemented behavior matches the gameplay meaning expressed by the card description/text
